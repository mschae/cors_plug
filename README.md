An [Elixir Plug](http://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) to add [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

## Usage

1. Add this plug to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  # ...
  {:cors_plug, "~> 1.2"},
  #...
end
```

When used together with the awesomeness that's the [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/)
please note that putting the CORSPlug in a pipeline won't work as they are only invoked for
matched routes.

I therefore recommend to put it in `lib/your_app/endpoint.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Enpoint, otp_app: :your_app

  # ...
  plug CORSPlug

  plug YourApp.Router
end
```

Alternatively you can add options routes, as suggested by @leighhalliday

```elixir
scope "/api", PhoenixApp do
  pipe_through :api

  resources "/articles", ArticleController
  options   "/articles", ArticleController, :options
  options   "/articles/:id", ArticleController, :options
end
```

## Configuration

This plug will return the following headers:

On preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests:

* Access-Control-Allow-Origin
* Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
* Access-Control-Max-Age
* Access-Control-Allow-Headers
* Access-Control-Allow-Methods

On `GET`, `POST`, ... requests:

* Access-Control-Allow-Origin
* Access-Control-Expose-Headers
* Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

You can configure allowed origins as follows:

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, origin: ["http://example1.com", "http://example2.com"]
```

Alternatively, you can use a regex:

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, origin: ~r/https?.*example\d?\.com$/
```

And also you can put configuration into config.exs:
```elixir
config :cors_plug,
  origin: ["foo.bar"],
  max_age: 86400,
  methods: ["GET", "POST"]
```
Please note that options passed to the plug overrides app config but app config overrides default options.

Please find the list of current defaults in [cors_plug.ex](lib/cors_plug.ex#L5:L15).
