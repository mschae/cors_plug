An [Elixir Plug](http://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) to add [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

## Usage

1. Add this plug to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  # ...
  {:cors_plug, "~> 2.0"},
  #...
end
```

When used together with the awesomeness that's the [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/)
please note that putting the CORSPlug in a pipeline won't work as they are only invoked for
matched routes.

I therefore recommend to put it in `lib/your_app/endpoint.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :your_app

  # ...
  plug CORSPlug

  plug YourApp.Router
end
```

Alternatively you can add options routes, as suggested by @leighhalliday

```elixir
scope "/api", PhoenixApp do
  pipe_through :api

  resources "/articles", ArticleController
  options   "/articles", ArticleController, :options
  options   "/articles/:id", ArticleController, :options
end
```

## Configuration

This plug will return the following headers:

On preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests:

* Access-Control-Allow-Origin
* Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
* Access-Control-Max-Age
* Access-Control-Allow-Headers
* Access-Control-Allow-Methods

On `GET`, `POST`, ... requests:

* Access-Control-Allow-Origin
* Access-Control-Expose-Headers
* Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

You can configure allowed origins using one of the following methods:

### Using a list

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, origin: ["http://example1.com", "http://example2.com"]
```

### Using a regex

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, origin: ~r/https?.*example\d?\.com$/
```

### Using the config.exs file

```elixir
config :cors_plug,
  origin: ["http://example.com"],
  max_age: 86400,
  methods: ["GET", "POST"]
```

### Using a `function/0` that returns the allowed origin as a string

**Caveat: Anonymous functions are not possible as they can't be quoted.**

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, origin: &MyModule.my_fun/0

def my_fun do
  "http://example.com"
end
```

You may also use a `function/1` which takes the `conn` as its argument:

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, origin: &MyModule.my_fun/1

def my_fun(conn) do
  conn.assigns.cors_allowed_origins
end
```

### send_preflight_response?

There may be times when you would like to retain control over the response sent to OPTIONS requests. If you
would like CORSPlug to only set headers, then set the `send_preflight_response?` option to false.

```elixir
plug CORSPlug, send_preflight_response?: false

# or in the app config

config :cors_plug,
  send_preflight_response?: false
```

Please note that options passed to the plug overrides app config but app config
overrides default options.

Please find the list of current defaults in
[cors_plug.ex](lib/cors_plug.ex#L5:L26).

**As per the [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-header)
the string `null` is returned when no configured origin matched the request.**
